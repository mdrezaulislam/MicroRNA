# MicroRNA

An R package to derive microRNA counts from high throughput sequencing data
Currently the package is suitable to quantify microRNAs only for human and
mouse. 

The package reports quality of the sequencing files, map raw sequencing data to the genome and
generates microRNA counts in .RData format ready for downstream analysis (e.g. normalization, differential expression,
clustering etc.). microRNA accessions are based on miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org/) annotations (version 22).
